*   **📁 Interactive Projects Showcase:** Hovering over featured project elements dynamically reveals a sliding card that tracks the user's cursor position with smooth GSAP damping.
*   **📜 Smooth Inertial Scrolling:** Integrated with **Lenis Smooth Scroll** to deliver a premium, high-end scrolling experience across browsers.

## 🚀 Setup & Local Preview

Since this project runs entirely on vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, you can run it locally without installing complex build pipelines.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/madhusatyakumarkatta/studio-replica.git
    cd studio-replica
    ```

2.  **Open the project:**
    *   Simply double-click the `index.html` file to open it in your browser.
    *   *Alternatively (Recommended):* Run it using a local development server like VS Code's **Live Server** extension or Python's HTTP server to ensure local assets (videos/fonts) load correctly with correct CORS policies:
        ```bash
        # Python 3
        python -m http.server 8000
        ```
        Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser.
